# weather-app

In this project, there's an app that lets the user search forecast data from any location through the weather API. More information here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-weather-app
<br>
It uses some of the previously learned concepts:

- Promises / async and await
- JSON
- API

## To-do

- Refactor code
- Add more info in forecast data
- Display background images based on the current weather
- Improve styling (fonts, colors, animations, etc.)
- Implement form validation
